# InstaReset - _Forgot Instagram Password_ using Python !

<br>

## What is this?
This script was made to send a Instagram reset password request using Python **without asking for reCAPTCHA** as Instagram does if we used a browser, It supports username and email methods.

## How it works ?
This script works by using a faked mobile user agent like `Instagram 150.0.0.0.000 Android (29/10; 300dpi; 720x1440)` and send a POST request to `https://i.instagram.com/api/v1/accounts/send_password_reset/` _with a random generated CSRF token of 32 chars_ in the request data.

## Features
- Faster ‚ö°
- No reCAPTCHA ü§ñ
- Nice looking CLI üé®
